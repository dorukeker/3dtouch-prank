# 3D Touch Prank

A one-page to help you pull a prank to your friends.
The example can be found [here](https://dorukeker.github.io/3dtouch_prank/)

1. Tell your friend that this is a page to practice the forced touch on HTML. (or some other fake story)
2. Make them press the button and watch the first label increase to 1.00 and turn green
3. Then do for the next one
4. Then for the 3rd one. Around 0.85 you will hear a crack sound and the screen will look as if it was cracked.

For now it works only with iPhone 6s, with 3D touch.
Have fun! :)

P.S. Send me a message about your fake stories. I am curious what you will come up with.
